## About Me

I am a passionate developer with a rich history of projects and contributions. Unfortunately, my previous GitHub account (@haitham-alabdullah) was suspended, causing me to lose access to over 60 repositories, including many private ones. Despite this setback, I am determined to continue my work and share my knowledge with the community.

## Previous Work

Here are some highlights of my previous work:

- Developed numerous web applications using modern frameworks.
- Contributed to open-source projects, enhancing functionality and fixing bugs.
- Created several libraries and tools to improve developer productivity.

## Current Projects

I am currently rebuilding my portfolio and working on new projects. Stay tuned for updates!
